Welcome to DynaPage! This document will walk you through installing your webpage on your Windows computer.
1. Obtain a web hosting program. It must support PHP. On Windows Server we recommend IIS. On regular editions of Windows, we recommend XAMPP.
2. Find your wwwroot folder. Read documentation if you cannot find it.
3. Copy entire contents of DynaPage to the wwwroot of your server. IT MUST BE AT THE ROOT OF THE FOLDER.
4. Open your web browser and go to "http://localhost" without the quotes.
5. If you see an error about SQL, it works. If you see code and random white boxes you did not install PHP correctly. See the troubleshooting page on the DynaPage wiki.
6. You are now ready to move on to the next step of the setup. Open the /doc/setup/settings.txt file to learn how to customize your installation of DynaPage.
