DynaPage
========

Simple blogging platform to get school clubs and small buisnesses up and running with their website.

The goal of this project is to supply a simple package that can be delivered to a page, run a script file, and the site is ready to go. Beyond that, modifications will be simple through an easy to use web interface, along with a simple scripting language for more advanced users. The internals of the software will also be availible when buisnesses or clubs wish to have total control over their website.
