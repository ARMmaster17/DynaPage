DynaPage is a modify-able website toolkit that allows you to create your own dynamic website with **ZERO** technical knowledge. No need to wrangle with Apache modules and SQL databases. Just copy, paste, and start creating your website.

# Why DynaPage?
DynaPage allows you to create your website from within your browser, not an HTML editor. And if you want to add something to your site that's not supported by the DynaPage interface, DynaPage is very easy to edit. You can create modules in any language that supports CGI interfacing. And if you really need to, DynaPage is completely open-source, allowing you to modify the internals of DynaPage for even more customization power.

# How do I install DynaPage?
1. Download DynaPage from the "releases" page.
2. Copy the files to your server directory.
3. Visit http://your.url.com/first
4. Follow the instructions to set up your website.

# What if I run into problems?
Take a look at our [wiki](https://github.com/NETponents/DynaPage/wiki). First see if your problem is under the *Known Issues* tab. If not, look at the *Troubleshooting* page. If you still have problems, file an issue [on our GitHub page](https://github.com/NETponents/DynaPage/issues) and our developer(s) will get to work right away! Please do not email or message us about bugs. Unless it is offically documented on the issues page, we cannot recognize it as a valid issue.
