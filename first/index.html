      <h3>Thank you for choosing DynaPage!</h3>

      <h3>What will I need?</h3>
      <p>You will need the following pieces of information: </p>
      <br />
      <ul>
        <li>The URL of your website (Eg: http://mywebsite.com). If you don't have one, leave this field blank.</li>
        <li>The name of your website (Eg: All things blogging) and a motto/slogan (if you would like one).</li>
      </ul>
      <p>Although DynaPage is built to solve most problems on its own, we can't account for every possible problem out there. We reccommend you have someone good with technology by your side as you walk through this setup.</p>

      <h3>What happens next?</h3>
      <p>The next stage of setup will test your server to make sure it has the required software. If you are using a hosting company or an existing web server, this should go smoothly. If everything works, you will see a big green "Success" button. If you see a blank page or your browser offers to download a .php file, then you should seek help from a knowledgable person.</p>
